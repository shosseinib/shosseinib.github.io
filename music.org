* *Code of Conduct*
Here I collect music albums that I consider worshiped (in my way) works in ~Jazz~, ~Post-Everything~, ~Noise~, ~*Metal~, ~Electronic~, and ~Experimental & Improvisation~. The order is by year, but there is no order; I may re-sort them by their artist name later; who knows?

  I love how the Slovak language is like the Icelandic language. After listening to this album, I've searched a little about Slovakia and found some interesting facts. By the way, I've liked the entire natural-leading process of the album. Feature track: *=6. Interlude III=*!
  #+end_quote
- Healing Potpourri *Paradise* [[https://healingpotpourri.bandcamp.com/album/paradise?from=embed][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  Ok, I should confess. At first, I was not too fond of the album because I thought it was a *=Stephan Stevens=* -y album, but as it sought forward, I found it's a complicated multi-instrumental album. With great tuning, orchestra, and lyrics. Great. Great. Favourite Track: *=6. Paradise=*.

  #+begin_quote
  As you can guess from the album's name, it's a complication from some memorable songs in a wide spectrum of subgenres of *=Jazz=*.
  #+end_quote
- Funk Is My Religion *Nils Landgren Funk Unit* [[https://nilslandgrenfunkunit.bandcamp.com/album/funk-is-my-religion][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  Yes, They say that *=Funk=* is a religion. They try to prove it by instruments and vocals. Feature song: *=5. Es in  Memoriam=*.
  #+end_quote
- Lars Danielsson *Cloudland* [[https://larsdanielsson.bandcamp.com/album/cloudland][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote

- Gordon Grdina's Haram *Night's Quietest Hour* [[https://gordongrdina.bandcamp.com/album/nights-quietest-hour?from=fandiscflw][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  A classic Fusion of *=Jazz=*, *=Arabic=*, and *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandari_music][Bandari]]* music. Feature track: *=3. Dulab Bayati=*
  #+end_quote 
- Branko Mataja *Over Fields And Mountains* [[https://brankomataja.bandcamp.com/album/over-fields-and-mountains?from=fanpub_fnb_pr][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  Something between *Ennio Morricone* and many others!
  #+end_quote
- Smith Komma John *Music For Humans* [[https://smithkommajohn.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-humans?from=fanpub_fnb][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  Norway!
  #+end_quote
- Duval Timphty *Meeting with a Judas Tree* [[https://duvaltimothy.bandcamp.com/album/meeting-with-a-judas-tree][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  A great experimental ~fusion~ piece of work. You can hear some post-rockish sounds merged with electronic music. Besides the artist claims that he inspired by ~hip-hop~. I couldn't hear anything from this point, at least at three fist listening of it. Featured Track: *=2. Wood ft. Yu Su=*.
  #+end_quote
- Bill Frisell *Four (Blue Note)* [[https://open.spotify.com/album/0GhCs8GREBNY1uUZhHQuYr][Spotify]]
  #+begin_quote
  This may be the last =jazz= album I reviewed in 2022. There are a bunch of albums I collected or ignored to listen to later. But I'm happy I listened to this album only one month after its release. You hear many "fresh" and harmonic sounds from the first track. I can get sleepy, excited, and even sad when you enjoy the quality of the mix, primarily when you focus on the drum's mix and mastering. You can feel every step of the piano's pedal changing, and even more, you can see the saxophone's key pressings in your imagination. 
  #+end_quote
* **Metal*
** Death
*** 2022
- Septicflesh *Modern Primitive* [[https://septicflesh.bandcamp.com/album/modern-primitive?from=fanpub_nfnb_pr][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  Finally, Septicflesh is here! A great greek band with a homogeneous discography in the manner of album art but not in their taste in music. Their last album is a fusion. A fusion of folk music and death, lyrical verses, and of course, enough harshness. Featured Track: *=3. Self-Eater=*.
  #+end_quote
** Doom
*** 2021
- Abysmal Grief *Funeral Cult of Personality* [[https://sunandmoonrecords.bandcamp.com/album/funeral-cult-of-personality][bandcamp]]
- Funeralium *Funeralium* [[https://funeralium.bandcamp.com/album/funeralium?from=fannewrel][bandcamp]]
- Swallow The Sun *Moonflowers* [[https://open.spotify.com/album/5RuHZCFV4cYtFIrj4NIXek][spotify]]
- Funeral Mist *Deiform* [[https://funeralmist.bandcamp.com/album/deiform?from=fandiscflw][bandcamp]]
- Akelei *Een van ons* [[https://akelei.bandcamp.com/album/een-van-ons?from=fandiscflw][bandcamp]]
- So Hideous *None But a Pure Heart Can Sing* [[https://silentpendulumrecords.bandcamp.com/album/none-but-a-pure-heart-can-sing?from=fanpub_fnb_pr][bandcamp]]
*** 2022
- Where Myth Becomes Memory *Rolo Tomassi* [[https://rolotomassi.bandcamp.com/album/where-myth-becomes-memory?from=fanpub_fnb_pr][bandcamp]]
- Dismalimerence, Nurez, olim, and The Wolf Garden *Recurrence (split)* [[https://thewolfgarden.bandcamp.com/album/recurrence-split?from=fanpub_fnb_pr&utm_campaign=thewolfgarden+album+recurrence-split][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  I just wondered about how there is a huge atmosphere around each song. Screams, melodies, and tonality are in a perfect balance. Favourite Track: *=Nurez - Sommer=*
  #+end_quote
- Obsessions  *Notturno* [[https://hypnoticdirgerecords.bandcamp.com/album/obsessions][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  Holy *=Doom=*, holy scream, holy poem. A very cheerful EP where you can find the deepest kind of darkness you want. Feature track *=3.Falling=*.
  #+end_quote
- Pyrithe *Monuments to Impermanence* [[https://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/album/monuments-to-impermanence][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  I wasn't sure if I should put this album on the recommendation list. So, I listened to it twice; after that, the fifth Track, *=5. Luminous=* to do that. Drums player, you nailed it!
  #+end_quote
- Nova *Sylvaine* [[https://sylvainemusic.bandcamp.com/album/nova?from=fanpub_nfnb_pr][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  It hit me at *=2. Mono No Aware=* where clean soprano voice combined by growl vocal. You know, That amazing moment...
  #+end_quote
- Darkher *The Buried Strom* [[https://darkher-uk.bandcamp.com/album/the-buried-storm?from=fanpub_nfnb_pr][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  The album has all factors and materials. But it wouldn't start from the first Track. It makes you thirsty until you've reached *=7. Immortals=*, but when it starts, it will not end very soon.
  #+end_quote
- Mournful Congregation *The Exuviae of Gods - Part I* [[https://20buckspin.bandcamp.com/album/the-exuviae-of-gods-part-i?from=fanpub_fnb_pr&fan_action_pane=login&fan_action=follow][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  A classic doom metal, with long reefs, great basses, and lyrical procedure. Feature track: *=3. An Epic Dream Of Desire=*.
  #+end_quote
- Sadness *To despair of ... (2014)* [[https://sadnessmusic.bandcamp.com/album/to-despair-of?from=fanpub_fnb&utm_source=album_release&utm_medium=email&utm_content=fanpub_fnb&utm_campaign=sadnessmusic+album+to-despair-of][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  Re-announcing this album exposed this masterpiece to me. I don't want select albums released before 2020 here, but in this case, I do.
  #+end_quote
- Deathwhite *Grey Everlasting* [[https://deathwhite.bandcamp.com/album/grey-everlasting?from=fanpub_nfnb_pr&utm_source=album_release&utm_medium=email&utm_content=fanpub_nfnb_pr&utm_campaign=deathwhite+album+grey-everlasting][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  A silent, heavy, and atmospheric album by an American band. I wouldn't say I like how they promoted their album by tagging other bands on the Bandcamp page, but it tells us: Amorphis, Katatonia (ew), Swallow the Sun, etc. Favourite Track: *=10. Blood and Ruin=*.
  #+end_quote
** Progressive
- Venus Principle *Stand In Your Light* [[https://venusprinciple.bandcamp.com/album/stand-in-your-light-deluxe-edition?from=fanpub_nfnb_pr][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
Let's be honest. It's too rare for me to listen to a combo of male and female vocals and not enjoy the song. In this case, the *=fifth=* track named *=The Lord He Giveth And He Taketh Away=* got me. 
  #+end_quote
- Ashenspire *Hostile Architecture* [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7QpOwvXOs&list=OLAK5uy_nxZGJsqQpwwPwwxWf82xfKF8Y8YrwKreM&index=1][youtube]]
  #+begin_quote
  A guy said it's a "Post Black Metal." But no. It's a Fusion Jazz Post-Metal. No, wait, it's Spoken Fusion Post Jazz Metal. Nah, it's Progressive Spoken Fusion Post Jazz Metal, right? It's better. Even now, I missed the "classical" part. It's all. It's every kind of intelligence that you can use in an album. Favourite Track: *=3. Plattenbau Persephone Praxis=*.
  #+end_quote
* *Noise*
** 2022
- Portal to the God Damn Blood Dimension *Rotten Fruit; Regular Orchard* [[https://portaltothegoddamnblooddimension.bandcamp.com/album/rotten-fruit-regular-orchard?from=fandiscflw][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  A double-track EP with noise, verse-like spoken words, and screams.
  #+end_quote
- R. Weis *Installed: Sound For Exhibitions* [[https://wormholeworld.bandcamp.com/album/installed-sound-for-exhibitions?from=fanpub_fnb_pr][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  What do you want from a *=noise=* album? I answer you I need every sound which it can define under chaotic noises. Spoken words, whispers, instruments, and urban sounds. All of them are in this album. Featured Track: *=11. Requiem for a Paperweight (Chapters 5 and 6)=*.
  #+end_quote
- Heavy Clound *Crossing The Water* [[[https://wormholeworld.bandcamp.com/album/crossing-the-water?from=fanpub_fnb_pr][bandcamp]]]
  #+begin_quote
  Ok, I'm a little biased, but the fourth Track *=Their leaves do not wish us to hurry=* is great. Listen to find out what I mean.
  #+end_quote
* *Post-everything*

- Der Weg Einer Freihei *Noktvrn* [[https://derwegeinerfreiheitsom.bandcamp.com/album/noktvrn?from=fanpub_nfnb_pr][bandcamp]]
- Secret Gardens *Tundra* [[https://secretgardens.bandcamp.com/album/tundra][bandcamp]]
  #+begin_quote
  I'm skeptical about recently released albums. But Tundra changed my mind. It's a combo of grunge, spoken words, nature-ambient-new age with real rock roots. Favourite Track: *=3. Silliness (feat. Erin Reus)=*.
  #+end_quote
  #+begin_quote
  _PS_ Ok, I've changed my mind; my favourite Track is *=6. I'm Fucking Tired of Being Sad=*.

  After a few months, I finally found an excellent vocal post-rock album. I'm pleased and blessed. Feature track: *=2. Good morning (red)=*.
